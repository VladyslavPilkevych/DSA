  <h1>Algorithm Collection in C</h1>
  
  <p>This repository is a collection of efficient and well-known algorithms implemented in C. Each folder is categorized based on the task or problem, with various algorithms optimized for solving those specific tasks.</p>

  <h2>Repository Structure</h2>
  <p>The repository is structured as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Folder per Task:</strong> Each folder represents a specific type of computational task (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithms for Each Task:</strong> Within each task folder, you'll find different algorithms optimized for that task.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the repository:
      <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithm-collection-c.git</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Navigate to the folder of the task you're interested in.</li>
    <li>Open the C files corresponding to the algorithm you're studying or implementing.</li>
    <li>Compile the program using GCC or any C compiler:
      <pre><code>gcc algorithm_name.c -o algorithm_name</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Run the executable:
      <pre><code>./algorithm_name</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Folder Examples</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sorting:</strong> Contains algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Searching:</strong> Includes Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Contains solutions to problems like the Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Graph Algorithms:</strong> Algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path, Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for Minimum Spanning Tree, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Mathematical Algorithms:</strong> Contains number-theory-based algorithms like GCD, LCM, Prime Factorization, etc.</li>
  </ul>

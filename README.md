<h1>Algorithm Collection in C</h1>

<p>This repository is a collection of efficient and well-known algorithms implemented in C. Each folder iscategorized based on the task or problem, with various algorithms optimized for solving those specific tasks.</p>

<h2>Repository Structure</h2>
<p>The repository is structured as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Task Folders:</strong> Each folder represents a specific algorithm or problem-solving task. Inside each folder, you will find:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>main.c:</strong> The C source file that contains the implementation of the algorithm.</li>
    <li><strong>task.txt:</strong> A text file describing the problem or task the algorithm is solving.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository:
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithm-collection-c.git</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Navigate to the folder containing the algorithm you're interested in (e.g., <code>07_ShortestPaths</code>).</li>
  <li>Read the <strong>task.txt</strong> file to understand the problem the algorithm solves.</li>
  <li>Open the <strong>main.c</strong> file to study the code or make modifications.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Folder Examples</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sorting:</strong> Contains algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Searching:</strong> Includes Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), etc.<li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Contains solutions to problems like the Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Graph Algorithms:</strong> Algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path, Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for Minimum Spanning Tree, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Mathematical Algorithms:</strong> Contains number-theory-based algorithms like GCD, LCM, Prime Factorization, etc.</li>
</ul>
